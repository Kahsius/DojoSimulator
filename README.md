# DojoSimulator

## What it is ?

Dojo Simulator is a python script running a set of matches of the prototype game "Dojo, duel of masters". The results are then used to balance the game depending on the results of each character (Prodigy).

## Usage

Simply clone the project, give the right permission to main.js and run it :
```python
./main.js N_TEST
```
with N_TEST the number of games you want the simulator to play. Default is 10.000 .

## Results

After the N_TEST games, the script displays the results in terms of win rate of each character, either by round or by game.
